#        Description:
#            This test will verify that the hash property gets populated every
#            time litp upgrade is run.
#        Actions:
#            1. Add an upgrade item under the deployment.
#            2. Get the hash values for each nodes upgrade item.
#            3. Verify that nodes get the same hash value.
#            5. Get a new hash values by running litp upgrade
#            6. Verify elements in list are unique.
#            7. Remove the upgrade items from model.
#        Result:
#            The hash property gets populated every time litp upgrade is run.
